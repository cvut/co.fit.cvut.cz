                Faculty of Information Technology targets to educate highly specialized IT professionals as a main
                element of innovative potential of companies and institutions especially in Czech Republic. We are
                systematically building scientific research capacities which enable us to teach students the latest
                trends and knowledge but also to offer expertise consulting and realize projects in cooperation with
                companies and institutions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Solid and long-term relationships with industrial partners belong to the historical tradition of the
                Czech Technical University in Prague. At the Faculty of Information Technology we are trying to make
                cooperation with industrial sphere as mutually beneficial as possible. Industrial partners are not only
                the target sphere for our absolvents but also important partners for forming our studying programs and
                scientifical researches and activities. To improve and systematize this cooperation we have prepared
                program of partnership called FITpartner. FITpartner enables companies and institutions to influence
                future development and specialization of our students but also it is possible close cooperation on
                researches. This program has various forms of partnership divided according commitment of companies
                to the faculty.

        <p>
            Many students are employed during their studies. But their work is not usually connected to school although
            it might have been. Thanks to SSP portal it is possible to solve this problem and connect part-time jobs
            with school duties. So students can cooperate with companies and take part on interesting projects from IT,
            develop skills and learn programming languages and technologies used in practise.
        </p>

        <p>
            We would like to support interesting projects and create nice place to cooperate together on new knowledge
            come in concrete innovations. This system gives to the Faculty strong feedback which is used to improve
            practical parts of subjects.

                What new is planned in CWI?
            </h3>

            <p>
                We are constantly thinking of new ways of improving the portal and still working on development of new
                functions. We’d like to inform you about some of them.

            </p>

            <p>
                First, we want to increase a support of faculty experts who help to industrial partners with creating
                assignments, provide expert advise and can lead work teams. Next change will be that other users
                (students, teachers and experts) can suggest their own assignments and requirements. After that
                industrial partners (companies) could pick the assignment which they are interested in and want to
                sponsor. We can’t forget to mention making of redesign of front page of portal SSP. It will make your
                work with portal easier, quicker and keeps you informed about all news. Stay tuned!
